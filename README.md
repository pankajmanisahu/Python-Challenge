# Introduction to Computer Programming - Summative Assessment

This repository contains my solutions to the summative assessment for the "Introduction to Computer Programming" course. The project showcases a variety of Python programming tasks, each demonstrating fundamental programming skills and concepts.

## Project Overview

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository covers a series of diverse programming challenges, ranging from basic arithmetic operations to more complex tasks involving data structures, control structures, and problem-solving techniques in Python. Key topics include:

- Basic Arithmetic Operations and Error Handling
- Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries)
- Control Structures (Loops, Conditional Statements)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts
- Exception Handling in Python
- Functional Programming with Lambda Functions
- Algorithmic Challenges and Logical Problem Solving

## Features and Highlights

- Implementation of basic to intermediate algorithms and data structures.
- Demonstrations of Python's OOP capabilities through class design and method implementation.
- Practical use of exception handling to create robust and error-free code.
- Functional programming techniques using lambda functions and list comprehensions.
- Calculation and data manipulation tasks simulating real-world scenarios.
